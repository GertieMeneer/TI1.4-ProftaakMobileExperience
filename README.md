# Major Project "Mobile Experience"
Made by me, https://github.com/Stefsk-glitch, and 3 other students

## Project Description
- For this project, we had to come up with an original idea. We had to make an Android app, and use an esp32 to create some sort of cool experience for users in an attraction park.
- We decided to make 1 (of the many) cartoon animals, which children would try to hunt for in the park. Every animal would have a simple block painting of the animal.
- The idea was to create an Android app where a child would be able to connect to the esp32 (using a code, shown on the LCD screen), and then it had to draw the block painting in the app. If the pattern is correct, a balloon would be seen on the LED matrix display and it would unlock a story in the app. If it is wrong, the LED's would flash and the child would have to try again.
